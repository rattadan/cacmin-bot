# CAC Admin Bot

Cosmos Airdrops Chat administration bot built with [Telegraf](https://telegraf.js.org/) in TypeScript. Combines advanced moderation features with a unified wallet system for JUNO cryptocurrency, using an internal ledger architecture backed by SQLite.

## Features

### Role Management
- **Four-tier role hierarchy**: `owner` > `admin` > `elevated` > `pleb`
- **Owner**: Full control including wallet/treasury access, role promotions, bot configuration
- **Admin**: Moderation powers (jail, restrictions, blacklist) but NO access to funds, treasury, or config
- **Elevated**: Basic user with wallet access, can view lists and statistics
- **Pleb**: Default role for all users

### Unified Wallet System
- Single JUNO wallet with internal ledger for all users
- Automatic deposit detection via RPC monitoring with memo-based routing
- Instant, fee-free internal transfers between users
- Secure withdrawal flow with transaction locking
- Complete audit trail of all financial operations
- See [LEDGER.md](LEDGER.md) for technical details
- See [ADMIN_MANUAL.md](ADMIN_MANUAL.md) for operational documentation

### Open Giveaway System
- Any user can create giveaways funded from their own balance
- Owners/admins can fund giveaways from treasury
- Configurable slot counts (10, 25, 50, 100 users)
- Users claim slots via inline button
- Per-giveaway escrow accounts for fund isolation
- Creators can cancel and reclaim unclaimed funds

### Content Moderation
- **User Restrictions**: Block specific users from stickers, URLs, media, regex patterns
- **Global Restrictions**: Apply content rules to all non-elevated users
- **Jail System**: Temporary mutes with configurable duration and bail payments
- **Safe Regex**: Timeout-protected pattern matching prevents ReDoS attacks
- See [REGEX_PATTERNS.md](REGEX_PATTERNS.md) for pattern examples

### Violation Tracking
- Log user violations with configurable penalties
- Fine system with USD-to-JUNO conversion
- Bail payments for early jail release

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd cacmin-bot
yarn install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with required configuration
yarn setup-db
./rebuild.sh          # Production
./rebuild.sh --dev    # Development
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `BOT_TOKEN`: Telegram Bot API token
- `OWNER_ID`: Primary owner Telegram user ID
- `BOT_TREASURY_ADDRESS`: Juno wallet address
- `BOT_TREASURY_MNEMONIC`: Wallet seed phrase (24 words)
- `JUNO_RPC_URL`: Primary Juno RPC endpoint

**Rebuild Options:** `./rebuild.sh [--dev|--quick|--full]`

## Production Deployment

### GitHub Release (Recommended)

```bash
wget https://github.com/cac-group/cacmin-bot/releases/latest/download/cacmin-bot-dist.tar.gz
tar -xzf cacmin-bot-dist.tar.gz
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installer creates a systemd service at `/opt/cacmin-bot` with proper permissions.

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment documentation.

### Key Patterns

- **Service-oriented**: Stateless services with static methods
- **Double-entry accounting**: Every transaction creates balanced ledger entries
- **Transaction locks**: Prevent double-spending during withdrawals
- **Escrow accounts**: Per-giveaway fund isolation
- **Protobuf parsing**: Structural memo extraction from RPC data
